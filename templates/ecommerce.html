            Electronic Commerce is a term that describes selling products on a digital market, usually either business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C). The process begins with a seller (either business or individual) listing their item on an online marketplace such as Amazon or Ebay. The customer (either another business or a direct consumer) finds the product and buys it online. Digital products are delivered to the buyer immediately, while physical products are shipped to the buyerâ€™s chosen address. Consumers are also able to sell directly to one another using intermediaries such as Facebook Marketplace and Ebay, or  even selling directly to a business. For instance, some artists sell their work for display in other businesses, or when photographers sell photos to stock photo companies for use online.

<br><br>Ecommerce is more convenient than physical shopping as you can buy anything ranging from furniture to food just from a smartphone. Listing a product on an online marketplace also allows sellers to include more information about a certain product in a more accessible way than small text or a label next to a price. It is also cheaper for businesses as digital marketplaces do not cost the rent that a physical shop would incur, and has more growth potential as location is not as much of a roadblock compared to physical shops.

<br><br>However, the anonymity that the internet provides leaves more opportunities for malpractice and scamming that a physical shop would not have, leading to a lower level of trust from customers. Instead of looking at a picture of a product that could be doctored or completely fake, a real shop would allow a customer to physically see a product and assess its real world condition before a purchase is made. Advertising would also be harder than in real life where people could simply see a store randomly by walking near it, as the internet as a whole is a much larger ecosystem, so the chances of encountering a digital store is much lower.
