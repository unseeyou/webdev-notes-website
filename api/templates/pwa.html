            A PWA is a website that has been built specifically to provide a similar/the same user experience as a fully fledged computer application. PWAs use techniques such as caching and a mix of client-side and server-side computation to work offline when the internet is not available. PWAs can run as websites, or installed to the device through a browser such as google chrome.

<br><br>PWAs are much more lightweight compared to traditional natively run apps, allowing lower end hardware to run them. Since they are able to be accessed as websites, their installation is as simple as installing the link to the PWA as an application on the computer, a much faster method of installation than downloading every single requirement for a locally run application. This also means the developer does not have to use different technologies during development for different systems, and can just make one version of the app that is able to run on all modern systems. PWAs are able to use all of the most prevalent features of a conventional app such as background processes and OS integration such as using the camera of a device.

<br><br>On the other hand, being a website, offline functionality is limited to whatever was cached when there was still an internet connection. The battery drain is also higher as the web app tends to use higher level code such as javascript which takes more processing power to run than a lower level language like C. There is also a slight overhead as a browser must be active to use the PWA. There could be an uneven amount of support for different browsers and operating systems, as some PWAs may rely on technologies that are only implemented in chromium and not able to be run on Firefox or any other non-chromium browser.
