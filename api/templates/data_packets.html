        <h3>how data is sent across the web</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <p>Data packets are units of data formatted for internet transfer. When information is sent over a network, it is broken down into smaller packets, which are then transmitted separately and reassembled at the destination. This process allows for efficient and reliable data transmission across networks.</p>
        <h3 id="key-concepts-in-data-packets">Key Concepts in Data Packets</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Packet Switching</strong>: A method of data transmission where data is broken into packets that are sent independently and can follow different paths to the destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Protocol</strong>: A set of rules that define how data packets are formatted and transmitted over a network. Common protocols include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).</li>
            <li><strong>Header and Payload</strong>: Each data packet consists of a header, which contains control information (such as source and destination addresses), and a payload, which is the actual data being transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route packets to their correct destinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Checksum</strong>: A value used to verify the integrity of a packet&#39;s data, ensuring that it has not been altered during transmission.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="common-uses-of-data-packets">Common Uses of Data Packets</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Internet Browsing</strong>: Webpages are transmitted to your browser in data packets.</li>
            <li><strong>Email</strong>: Emails are broken into packets for transmission over the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Streaming</strong>: Streaming services use data packets to deliver video content in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)</strong>: Voice data is transmitted as packets over the internet during calls.</li>
            <li><strong>File Transfers</strong>: Data packets are used to transfer files over networks, such as through FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-data-packets">Pros and Cons of Data Packets</h3>
        <h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Packet switching makes efficient use of network resources, as packets can take different paths to avoid congestion.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability</strong>: If a packet is lost or corrupted during transmission, only that packet needs to be resent, not the entire message.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Networks can easily scale to handle increased traffic by adding more routes for packets.</li>
            <li><strong>Fault Tolerance</strong>: The network can reroute packets around failed or congested nodes, ensuring continuous data flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Packet switching can handle a variety of data types and sizes, from small text messages to large multimedia files.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Latency</strong>: Packets may experience delays, especially if they take different paths to the destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Overhead</strong>: Each packet requires a header, which adds to the overall data being transmitted and can reduce efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Managing and reassembling packets requires complex protocols and algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Risks</strong>: Data packets can be intercepted and analysed, posing privacy and security threats.</li>
        </ol>
